Dynamics

Definition
Dynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationship between motion and the forces affecting it.
It explains why objects move the way they do and focuses on the causes of motion.
Key Concepts in Dynamics
1. Force
A push or pull that changes an object’s state of motion or rest.
Formula:
F = ma
Where F = force, m = mass, a = acceleration.
2. Newton’s Laws of Motion
First Law (Law of Inertia):

An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
Key Concept: Inertia depends on mass.
Second Law:

The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and occurs in the direction of the force.
Formula:
F = ma
(Force = Mass × Acceleration)
Third Law:

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Example: Rocket propulsion.
3. Momentum
The quantity of motion an object possesses.
Formula:
p = mv
Where p = momentum, m = mass, v = velocity.
4. Impulse
The change in momentum of an object when a force is applied over a time interval.
Formula:
Impulse = F × Δt = Δp
Where Δp = change in momentum.
5. Friction
A resistive force that opposes the motion of an object.
Types of friction:
Static Friction: Prevents motion.
Kinetic Friction: Opposes moving objects.
Formula:
F_friction = μN
Where μ = coefficient of friction, N = normal force.
6. Work-Energy Principle
Work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.
Formula:
W = ΔKE = (1/2)mv_f² - (1/2)mv_i²
7. Circular Motion
Centripetal Force: The force acting towards the center of the circular path.
Formula:
F_c = mv² / r
Where m = mass, v = velocity, r = radius of the circle.
8. Gravitational Force
The force of attraction between two masses.
Formula:
F_g = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²
Where G = gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ = masses, r = distance between them.
Key Formulas
Force:
F = ma

Momentum:
p = mv

Impulse:
Impulse = F × Δt = Δp

Friction:
F_friction = μN

Work:
W = F × d × cosθ
Where d = displacement, θ = angle between force and displacement.

Kinetic Energy:
KE = (1/2)mv²

Potential Energy:
PE = mgh
Where h = height above reference point.

Power:
P = W / t

Centripetal Force:
F_c = mv² / r

Gravitational Force:
F_g = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²

Key Points
Inertia:
Heavier objects resist changes in motion more than lighter ones.

Free-Body Diagrams:
Essential for solving problems in dynamics. They help visualize forces acting on an object.

Friction:

Static friction is usually greater than kinetic friction.
Friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact and the normal force.
Energy Conservation:
Total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved in the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction).

Centripetal Force:
It is not a new force; it is provided by forces like tension, gravity, or friction depending on the situation.

Interesting Questions and Answers
Q1: Why does a rocket move upward?
Answer: The rocket moves upward due to the reaction force exerted by the gases expelled downward (Newton’s Third Law).
Q2: Why do objects eventually stop moving if Newton’s First Law says they should continue?
Answer: External forces like friction and air resistance oppose motion and cause the object to stop.
Q3: What is the difference between mass and weight?
Answer: Mass is the amount of matter in an object (constant everywhere). Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object, given by W = mg.
Q4: How does the force of friction change with the weight of an object?
Answer: Friction increases with the normal force (weight for horizontal surfaces), as F_friction = μN.
Q5: Why do satellites stay in orbit?
Answer: Satellites are in free fall towards Earth, but their tangential velocity ensures they keep "missing" the surface, resulting in orbit.
