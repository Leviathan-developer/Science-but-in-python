Refraction of light

    The phenomenon of beding of light as it moves from one medium to another is called Refraction of light

Laws of Refraction of light
    1. The incident ray, reflected ray and normal ray lie in same plane.
    2. When light travels from rare medium to denser medium it must bend toward normal.
    3. When Light travels from denser medium to rarer medium it must bend away 
    4. The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of angle of the sine of angle of refraction is constant for two given media.

Formula:
µ=sin(i)/sin(r)

Refrective index
    The ratio of velocity of light in the vaccum to the velocity of light in other medium is called absolute refrective index

µ=c/v 

Relation of relative relative index

Two media
    If a light travels from a medium 'A' to another medium 'B'. The refrective index can be said as: 

AµB=Sini/sinr ---(1)

This is refractive index of medium b with respect to medium a 
    BµA=Sinr/Sini ---(2)

This is refractive index if medium A with respect to medium B

Multipling (1) and (2), we have

    AµB.BµA = sinr/sini * sinr/sini =1
    AµB= 1/ BµA

Note: The refrective index given in questions asked in exams is with respect to air

Three media:
    Fig: 15.2 ---(Pioner Physics book)

Here the ray travels from a,b,c and returns to a 

For refractive index
    aµb=sini/sinr
    bµc=sinr1/sinr2
    cµa=sinr/sini

Multiplying all index
    aµb.bµc.cµa=sini/sinr1*sinr1/sinr2*sinr2/sini=1
    aµb.bµc=1/cµa
    aµc=aµb.bµc [?: aµc=1/cµa from previous derivation]

Lateral shift
    The perpendicular distance between the produced incident ray and the emergent ray is called lateral shift.

    It is denoted by 'p' and
    p=t/cosr.sin(i-r)

    Fig:15.3
    Consider PQRS be the glass slab of thickness 't' from the figure
    In traigle BN'C 
    Cos(r)=b/h=PS/BC=t/BC
    BC=t/cosr

    In traingle BCM
    sin(i-r)=p/h=CM/BC
    BC=CM/sin(i-r)

    We have;
    CM/sin(i-r)=t/cosr
    CM=(t/cosr)*sin(i-r)

    Here CM is the lateral shift (P)
    Hence,
    P=(t/cosr)*Sin(i-r)

    Case(<i=90.deg)
    P=t/cosr (sin90-r)
    P=(t/cosr)*cosr
    P=t

    Here CM is the lateral shif(P)
    Hence,
    P=(t/cosr)*sin(i-r)

    Case(<i=90.deg)
    P=(t/cosr)*(sin90-r)
    P=(t/cosr)*cosr
    P=t

    Here; we observe that as the angle increases and tends to 90.deg the lateral shift tends to being equal to thickness of the glass slab

Real and Apparent depth
    The actual depth of a object is called Real depth.
    The observed depth of a object is called Apparent depth

    Prove d=t(1-(1/u))
    Fig 15.5 ---(Pioner physics book)
    Let i is the angle of incidence in medium and r is the angle of refrection in air.
    Then From Snell's Law,
    1/µ = sini/sinr
    µ=sinr/sini
    
    In traingle ABO , sini = AB/OB
    In traingle ABI , sinr = AB/IB

    Then, µ=sinr/sini=(AB/IB)/(AB/OB)=OB/IB

    For small angle of incidence, B is very close to A, then
    apparent depth = t/µ
    The apparent displacement of shift of the object is given by
    d= OI =OA-AI =Real depth - Apperent depth=t-(t/µ)
    d=t(1-(1/µ))

Critical angle

   The angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90.deg is called critical angle.
   This occurs when light goes from denser to rarer. It is denoted by C.

   Relation between critical angle and refrective index:

   µ=1/sinc

   Prove:
    Here;
    sini/sinr=1/µ [gµa=sini/sinr and aµg=1/gµa so; 1/gµa=sini/sinr]
    sinc/sin90=1/µ, critical angle 90.deg 
    sinc=1/µ
    µ=1/sinc (proved)

Total Internal Reflection (TIR)

Definition:
    TIR occurs when light traveling from a denser medium to a rarer medium is completely reflected back into the denser medium.

Conditions for TIR:
    1. The light must travel from a denser medium (higher refractive index, mu1) to a rarer medium (lower refractive index, mu2).
   mu1 > mu2
    2. The angle of incidence (i) in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle (ic).

Critical Angle:
    The critical angle (ic) is the angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the rarer medium becomes 90 degrees.

Formula:
    sin(ic) = mu2 / mu1

Where:
    mu1 = refractive index of the denser medium
    mu2 = refractive index of the rarer medium

Explanation:
    If i < ic: Light is refracted into the rarer medium.
    If i = ic: Light grazes along the boundary (refraction angle = 90 degrees).
    If i > ic: Light is completely reflected back, causing TIR.

Applications of TIR:
    1. Optical Fibers: Light signals are guided through fibers by repeated TIR.
    2. Prisms: Used in binoculars and periscopes to reflect light with no loss.
    3. Diamond Sparkle: High refractive index of diamond results in a small critical angle, causing multiple TIR and enhanced brilliance.
